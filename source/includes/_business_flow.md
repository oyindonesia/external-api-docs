Once you’re ready to execute real money-in and money-out transactions or integrate with OY!, follow the below check-list to ensure you’re all set up:  

1.  Create an account
2.  Upgrade your account by submitting the required documentations
3.  Have your upgrade request approved
4.  Set up your receiving bank account information (note: ensure that the receiving bank account information is accurate as it cannot be changed via OY! dashboard for security reasons)
5.  (Required if you want to use our API) Submit your IPs and callback URLs (both for staging and production environment) to your business representative or to [partner@oyindonesia.com](mailto:partner@oyindonesia.com)
6.  (Required if you want to use our API) Request your staging and production API Key to our business representative (note: you are not required to upgrade your account to request staging API Key. Upgrade is only required if you want to request Production API Key).
7.  (Optional) Perform testing. We recommend that you thoroughly test before going live. We’ve provided a Staging Mode in our dashboard, where you can test transactions to understand how our products work, without using real money. If you are a developer, you can also test your integrations.
8.  (Optional) If your company wants to have multiple users: Create additional sub-account users under User Management
