# Introduction

OY! API service enables business owners like you to receive payments from customers, either **from your Application** or independently **by sending your Payment URL to your customers**.

With quick and easy integration, your business can start accepting payments on Day 1 after registration.

OY! Bayar supports multiple payment methods, including *Direct Debit*, *Credit Cards*, and *Bank Virtual Accounts*.

# Quick Integration

> To open OY! Bayar webview, use following code from your platform:

```javascript
window.open("https://pay.oyindonesia.com/username", "_blank"); 
```

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(context, YourWebviewActivity.class);
intent.putExtra("url", "https://pay.oyindonesia.com/username")
startActivity(intent)
```

```swift
let controller = OyWebViewController()
controller.url = "https://pay.oyindonesia.com/username"
let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: controller)
present(navigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

> Make sure to replace `username` with your account username, given on the email.

### Get Payment URL for your business
![Signup for Trial](images/img_signup.png)

1. Register for a unique payment URL here: [https://business.oyindonesia.com/oybayar](https://www.oyindonesia.com/oybayar)
2. You will receive an email containing a unique payment URL for *trial version* of the checkout page. From here, you can immediately start the integration.

<aside class="warning">
Limitation of OY! Bayar (Trial Version)
</aside>

Payment URL for the *trial version* will have several limitations, including:

* Amount of payment is locked to Rp 10.000
* It contains BIG watermark mentioning unverified account (note: you are not supposed to use this for production)
* You don't get API Callback for payment result. However, you will notice that money will be sent to your bank account in real time

You can upgrade to OY! business partner to remove above limitations, by sending reply to the email that you receive. Our team will response your email quickly.

### How Does It Work?
![Integration flow](images/img_integration.png)

1. **Put the logic of opening webview** on your app button, so that whenever buyer clicks on "Payment" button, it will open OY! Bayar checkout webview
2. You implement your own **Product details page**
3. You implement your **Order System to create transactionId** for buyers to checkout their order
4. Your App/Web **opens OY! Bayar** Checkout page with additional parameters required
5. Buyer pays using any of *Direct Debit*, *Credit Cards*, or *Bank Virtual Accounts*.
6. You **receive money on your receiving account** and OY! will **send Payment status Callback** to your end point (note: Only available for non-trial account)
